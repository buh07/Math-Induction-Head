# Phase 1 Scripts

Canonical Phase 1 (Steering Baseline / Validated Baseline) entrypoints.

- `run_full_experiment.py` - legacy induction/steering multi-part plans
- `detect_induction_heads.py` - induction detector runs (plain/CoT or synthetic)
- `run_head_validity_suite.py` - Phase 1 / Plan A validity tranche orchestration

Root-level wrappers under `scripts/` are kept temporarily for compatibility and print deprecation notices.
