# Phase 1 Logs (Steering Baseline / Validated Baseline)

Phase 1 logs are organized by trust/status.

- `canonical/` - trusted orchestration/provenance logs (including final Plan A run log + status)
- `provisional_pre_fix/` - older/pre-fix logs kept for provenance
- `failed_or_partial/` - failed/interrupted/smoke-run logs

See `migration_map.json` for old->new log path mappings.
