# Phase 2 (Operator Heuristic Bottleneck Mainline)

This directory indexes the post-pivot mainline program.

## Scope

Phase 2 covers:
- operator-specific heuristic bottleneck mapping
- arithmetic-specific causal localization (attention + MLP)
- necessity/sufficiency + cross-operator specificity
- CoT gating/composition experiments
- future multi-model replication of the pivoted program

## Current status

- Documentation and project framing are updated for Phase 2.
- Phase 2 scripts/configs/artifacts are mostly placeholders in this reorg pass.
- See root docs for the current program narrative:
  - `README.md`
  - `overview.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `TODO.md`
